# Needle-Tissue Interaction Force Estimation Using Residuals
## Medical Robotics Couse Project
Roggiolani, G., Roscia, F., & Sodano, M. (2020)

Supervisor: Prof. Marilena VENDITTELLI


The aim of the project is a sensorless extimation of the exerted force between a needle attached to the end effector of the KUKA LWR-IV + manipulator and a tissue duringÂ a puncturing event, knowing the joint torques and configurations histories.
